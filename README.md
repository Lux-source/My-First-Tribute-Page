### Bullet Points

- [x] Element with corresponding `id="main"` containing all other elements.
- [x] Element with `id` of `title`, which contains a string, describing the subject of the tribute page.
- [x] `Div` element with an `id` of `img-div`.
- [x] Within the `img-div` element, we have an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.
- [x] Element with corresponding textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
- [x] Element with `link` which links to an external site containing aditional information.
- [x] `#image` using the `width` and `height` properties for responsiveness, relative to width of its parent element.
- [x] `img` element centered within its parent element.
