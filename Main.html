      <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of Vitalik Buterin's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1994</strong> - Born in Kolomna, Rusia</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Began writting  for a publication called Bitcoin Weekly after meeting a person on a bitcoin forum in order to earn bitcoin.
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - In September Mihai Alisie reached out to Buterin about starting a new print publication called Bitcoin Magazine, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute to as a leading writer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - Wrote what is considered the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.

            <strong>2014</strong> - Delivered a 25-minute speech, describing the general-purpose global computer operating on a decentralized permissionless network, ending with potential uses for Ethereum that ranged from crop insurance to decentralized exchanges to DAOs.

            <strong>2016</strong> - Held a position on the editorial board of Ledger.

              When I came up with Ethereum, my first first thought was, 'Okay, this thing is too good to be true.' As it turned out, the core Ethereum idea was good - fundamentally, completely sound.
